# Polyglot Project

## Purpose

A __polyglot__ is a person the knows *several* languages. This project is similar, in that it contains *sample* files from multiple programming languages. This file is an example in Markdown.

## Contents

The following languages are included in this project. Not all languages will be represented.

### Languages

 * Markup
    * Markdown
    * HTML
    * XML
 * Java
 * Bash
 * Ruby
 * Python
 * CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
 * JavaScript
    * TypeScript
    * CoffeeScript

### Markup

These are markup-style languages. Some purists may not even consider them true _languages_. However, to me, since they all have unique and specific __syntax__, that qualifies them in my book.

#### Markdown

**Markdown** was inspired by common text-based e-mail conventions to enhance plain text with additional meaning by using special characters for assumed formatting.

#### XML

E__x__tensible __M__arkup **L**anguage was created to provide a common way to communicate between different systems and could also be used as the basis of other document markup languages like **RSS**.

#### HTML

**H**yper**t**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage is the primary document language of the **W**orld-**w**ide **W**eb on the Internet.

### Java

Java is a C-style programming language was created by James Gosling of Sun Microsystems (acquired by Oracle).
